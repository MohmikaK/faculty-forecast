Revolutionizing Faculty Recruitment in Higher Education

Colleges and universities often struggle with the challenges of anticipating faculty vacancies and determining the optimal time to initiate the hiring process.
This leads to delayed recruitment, compromising the quality of education and increasing the workload on existing faculty members. In order to address this issue, we present Faculty Forecast, an innovative portal that transforms the way colleges and universities recruit faculty members.
